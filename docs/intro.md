# Introduction

Welcome! The pages that follow contain comprehensive documentation of the
Livepeer ecosystem. The documentation is split into two parts: Livepeer for
[video developers](/docs/video-developers/overview) and Livepeer for
[video miners](/docs/video-miners/overview). If you are new to Livepeer and
interested in how it works, you might want to check out the
[Protocol Overview](/docs/protocol/core-concepts/overview).

The documentation is an open-source community effort, so feel free to suggest
new topics, add new how-to guides, and provide examples wherever you think it
might be helpful. All documentation is editable via
[GitHub](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-org/tree/master/docs).
