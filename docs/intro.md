# Introduction

Welcome! The pages that follow contain comprehensive documentation of the
Livepeer ecosystem. The documentation is split into two parts: Livepeer for
[video developers](/docs/video-developers/overview) and Livepeer for
[video miners](/docs/video-miners/overview). If you are new to Livepeer and
interested in how it works, you might want to check out the
[Protocol Overview](/docs/protocol/core-concepts/overview).

The documentation is an open-source community effort, so feel free to suggest
new topics, add new how-to guides, and provide examples wherever you think it
might be helpful. All documentation is editable via
[GitHub](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-org/tree/master/docs).

## Something missing? {#something-missing}

If you find issues with the documentation or have suggestions on how to improve the documentation or the project in general, please [file an issue](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) for us, or send a tweet mentioning the [@docusaurus](https://twitter.com/docusaurus) Twitter account.

For new feature requests, you can create a post on our [feature requests board (Canny)](/feature-requests), which is a handy tool for roadmapping and allows for sorting by upvotes, which gives the core team a better indicator of what features are in high demand, as compared to GitHub issues which are harder to triage. Refrain from making a Pull Request for new features (especially large ones) as someone might already be working on it or will be part of our roadmap. Talk to us first!
